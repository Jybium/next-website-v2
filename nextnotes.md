# Nextjs Notes

Next js is built on top of React. It's a comprehensive framework for building full stack applications. While React on it's own is a library for builing interactive UIs

A framework often combines libraries plus tools and conventions for streamlining and building full stack apps. E.g Nextjs comes preconfigured with it's own router, so you won't need to use a seperate routing package like React Router

Nextjs also comes with preinstalled with it's own compiler for transpiling code, it's own CLI for starting & building apps and a Nodejs runtime for executing JavaScript code.

With a Nodejs runtime, you can write both frontend and backend code in the same Nextjs project. This means that you don't have to write server side code in a different language; it's all self contained.

## Routing & file system

In Next js, you don't have to have an src directory.

The app folder is often the top folder and it serves as the main container for our routing system in a Nextjs application. You don't have to configure routes and map them to your files like we do in React

We mentioned earlier that Nextjs's routing system is based on convention and not on configuration
